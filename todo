Goal: Have "staging" environment. On that environment, perform two automated chaos experiments - one in canary mode, the other in direct ("production"). 

X have example run via local
X Execute first end-to-end test in 'productio n' mode

x Fix chaos workers (right now, they just hang forever).
X Implement 'canary-mirror' mode and adjust chaos worker accordingly
X Execute test in 'canary-mirror' mode
x Implement traffic splitting for canary
- Execute test in 'canary-split' mode
- Figure out the right metric to use for canary "successCriterion", or disable successCriterion for canary tests
- Support test timeout
- Run same test in multiple modes?
- Fix high vulnerabilities
- Come up with more test scenarios
- Rename 'production' mode to 'primary'

- * Consider giving developers few more knobs to turn
- * Prep demo
- * Implement cleanup for chaos Tests
- * Refactor


# NICE TO HAVE
# UI for adding Chaos Tests
# UI for seeing test results
# Microservice test result visualisation map
