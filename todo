Goal: Have "staging" environment. On that environment, perform two automated chaos experiments - one in canary mode, the other in direct ("production"). 

X have example run via local
X Execute first end-to-end test in 'productio n' mode

x Fix chaos workers (right now, they just hang forever).
X Implement 'canary-mirror' mode and adjust chaos worker accordingly
X Execute test in 'canary-mirror' mode
x Implement traffic splitting for canary
X Execute test in 'canary-split' mode
X * Consider giving developers few more knobs to turn
X Run same test in multiple modes? Tricky. Requires to pull current VS and apply patch to it. 
X When 'successCriterion empty', let the test run continously.
- chaos-controller (when success criterion empty - throws error. That should not happen.)
- Test experiment without 'successCriterion'
- Fix high vulnerabilities
- Rename 'production' mode to 'primary'
- Come up with more test scenarios


- * Prep demo
- * Implement cleanup for individual chaos tests
- * Support test timeout
- * Refactor


# NICE TO HAVE
# UI for adding Chaos Tests
# UI for seeing test results
# Microservice test result visualisation map
